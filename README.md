- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrimsonCloak
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding but am too scared to commit hence my floating around here
- 🌱 I’m currently learning not too much to be fair but I'll get somewhere! Maybe
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet because I know not what to do
- 📫 How to reach me ... well just use github dunno why you'd need me honestly you weirdo...
